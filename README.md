# Project is a work-in-progress ðŸ”¨

The goal of the project is to set up a small infrastructure composed of different services under specific rules by using Docker containers.

## Main objectives:
- A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only
- A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and
  configured) only without nginx
- A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx
- A volume that contains your WordPress database
- A second volume that contains your WordPress website files
- A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers
